HOW TO:

1. Save the .zip file you want to use (e.g. ```onzred.zip```).
2. See the ```LOCATION.md``` file for where to place it (e.g ```\Documents\Maniaplanet\Skins\Models\StadiumCar```)
3. Create a new loc file in the same place (same file name + ```.loc```, e.g  ```onzred.zip.loc```)
4. Open the loc file with notepad, paste the URL of the zip file you downloaded (e.g ```https:///juney420.github.io/TrackmaniaLoc/onzcars/original/onzred.zip)``` and save it). Make sure there is no space before or after the URL, the URL is correct, etc.
5. Go to profile and select the right model. Other people should be able to see your skin (for cars, it will appear grey while the download is on-going. If other people see you as a random nation, something went wrong).
